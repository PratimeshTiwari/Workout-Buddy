->update page content on form submission without refresh 
->basically syncing its data with the database 
->react context is used here
#this helps to avoid passing workout state as props down to any component 
 that needs to use or update it 
#react context is a way we can provide global state to different components in 
 application and we can also update that state by dispatching actions from those
 components
#here global state = workout data from mongodb
#so then rather than passing workout state as props between components and pages to 
 update it , we can just access it and upate it directly then using a context provider 
 from any component

#reducer hook args : reducer function , initial value for states
 #reducer hook is similar to useState where we get a state value and a function(dispatch in this case)
 to update state values along with defining initial values through an object
