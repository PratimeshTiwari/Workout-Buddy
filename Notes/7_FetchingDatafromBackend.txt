Fetching data in react app using backend api 

Task : 
->fetching all the workout and list them in home page 
->to do that : we can use effectHook() 
->useEffectHook() fires a function when the component is rendered 
->we only want to call effectHook once when it first is rendered 
->effectHook args = function , emptyArray 
#here empty array makes use it is fired only once since it will be stored in the first call itself

#basically useEffect is going to fire Home function when the component first renders 

->install CORS (cross origin requests) if node and react server are not different ports
->else add proxy field to the front json file and set it to equal to node server address

Passing workout as a prop while making a react app : 
When you pass workout as a prop in a React app, it means that you're 
providing the workout data from a parent component to a child component.

#avoid refreshing page when workout is added from the workout form 
->to do this : update local state to keep it in sync with the database 
->this is done via React Context
