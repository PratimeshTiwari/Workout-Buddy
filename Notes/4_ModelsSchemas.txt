Schema : it defines the structure of a particular type of document inside a database 
Model : apply schema to a particular model and use that model to interact with 
        a collection of that name 

#create schemas so that each document in the database follows a common pattern

#1st schema arg = object is passed where we define this schema
#2nd schema arg = timestamp =>when we try to create a new document it auto adds 
                  a created app property like app creation , app updated 

#since request.json middleware is used ,all of that request body that comes along with the
 request is going to be passed onto the requst object so we can use it


#when we create a new document , once's that been created , the response we get 
 is the new document that was just created along with the id of the document
